            The actual drafting of the Catechism was delegated to a committee of seven residential bishops, assisted by Christoph Schönborn, O.P., of the University of Fribourg, Switzerland, and later cardinal archbishop of Vienna. In the initial drafts, prepared through 1987–88, the Catechism had three parts and an epilogue.The Catechism presents the history and tradition of the Church's doctrine in a complete yet summary way. It draws heavily from Scripture, the Church Fathers, liturgical texts and the lives and writings of the saints to illustrate the doctrinal content.
            The Catechism is arranged in four principal parts: The Profession of Faith (the Apostles' Creed) The Celebration of the Christian Mystery (the Sacred Liturgy, and especially the sacraments) Life in Christ (including the Ten Commandments)the Creed, the Sacraments, the Ten Commandments, the Lord's Prayer, and much more. It provides an in-depth look at the Catholic faith that one doesnt necessarily learn just by going to mass every week.
